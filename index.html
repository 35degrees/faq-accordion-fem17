							<p>
								The trailhead quota system limits use based on where you begin
								your hike, and in some cases, on where you camp the first night
								of your trip. After the first night, you may camp wherever you
								can hike to within the wilderness.

							<h3>Can a wilderness ranger plan this trip for me?</h3>

							<button class="faq-icon" aria-label="expand-button"></button>
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>
								As part of the wilderness experience, park rangers can provide
								general guidance but will not plan a wilderness trip for you;
								you must plan your own trip. The Yosemite Wilderness has over
								750 miles of trail to explore with a great range of elevation,
								ecological zones, and solitude. This backpacking trip, be it
								your first or fortieth, is a uniquely protected opportunity to
								provide maximum freedom to roam in wilderness.

							<button class="faq-icon" aria-label="expand-button"></button>
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>
								You can speak to a wilderness ranger by calling 209/372-0826
								(Monday through Friday, 9 am to noon and 1 to 4:30 pm, typically
								from late May through early October).

							<h3>How does the reservation lottery work?</h3>

							<button class="faq-icon" aria-label="expand-button"></button>
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>
								The lottery application period is seven days (Sunday through
								Saturday each week). You can specify up to eight options on each
								application, which can include any combination of dates (or
								valid date ranges), trailheads, and group sizes.
								<br /><br />During the application period, you can apply any
								time from midnight Sunday to 11:59 pm Saturday Pacific time.
								When you apply during the application period has no effect on
								your chances of success.
